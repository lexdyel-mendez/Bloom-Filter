* The Goal of project one is to create a Bloom Filter. based on multiple hashes.
* The Bloom Filter will be created dynamically based on dummy inputs (emails) from a file that must be evaluated at run time.
* Bloom Filter must have a false positive probability of 0.0000001
* You can understand the equations involved at https://hur.st/bloomfilter/
* Your program must take 2 files as inputs.
    - Example: python <your_program> db_input.csv db_check.csv
    - The input file names must not be hardcoded, it must take whatever input files the professor passes as input on whatever location.  It must not assume the file is in the local directory.
* The input comma-separated files will contain 1 column: Email.   Based on the email key, your program will build the Bloom Filter based on file 1 inputs.  Then it will need to check file 2 entries against the bloom filter and provide its assessment.
* Your program must create a results file (must be called results.csv) that will contain the following:
    - Example Output file
    Email,Result
    weseGLCIEPTUusDlU@aol.com,Probably in the DB
    uEUSgDKJN@hotmail.com,Not  in the DB
    PLekUVqtWnRVWShep,Not  in the DB
    BXgWIGaZRv@aol.com,Probably in the DB
* The application can be developed in the Language of your choosing between Python (preferred) or Java
* The Professor will run your code with his own parameters and will validate your implementation.
* The Rubric in this section contains the specific values of the specific aspects of the project.
* The application will be handled by e-mail to the professor with the following subject: "Project 2: Bloom Filter Code"
* The application due date is Friday April 22nd 2022 at 23:59:59
